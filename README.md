# Card React Component

## Introduction

This repository contains a very simple 'Card' type component that displays useful information. During the interview you will be asked to make some modifications to this component, **so you should familiarise yourself with this code**.

The code makes use of [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to provide a demonstration ability, you will not need to modify any of the storybook code, i.e. code underneath the [stories](./stories) directory.

The only changes you will need to make are in the [src/Card](./src/Card) directory.

## Setup
Please ensure you have this running locally prior to the interview.

First run
```
npm i
```
to install all of the dependencies. During installation, you may see errors related to `Error: Cannot find module 'nan'` or `husky > Failed to install`. You can ignore both of these.

Then run 
```
npm start
```
This will open [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) on `localhost:6006` in your browser. This gives you a live development environment where any changes made to the code will update in the storybook window.
