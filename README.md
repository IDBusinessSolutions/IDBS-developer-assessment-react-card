First run
```
npm i
```
to install all of the dependencies. During installation, you may see errors related to `Error: Cannot find module 'nan'` or `husky > Failed to install`. You can ignore both of these.

```
npm start
```
This will open [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) on `localhost:6006` in your browser. This gives you a live development environment where any changes made to the code will update in the storybook window.
